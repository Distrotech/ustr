 bad mb strings for fmt*.

 8byte refs
   ustr_owner()
   ustr_init_size()

 ustr_add(), where len1+len2 overflows

 utf8 from: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-test.txt


 FIX
 ---
 ustr_io_* ... unlocked IO for get/put/etc.? ... 
    esp. getfile/putfile as they can involve multi operations.
    needs autoconf_foo_unlocked


 ADD

 DOCS!

 ustr_utf8_reverse
