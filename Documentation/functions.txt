Section: Creating Ustr functions

Function: ustr_dup_empty()
 Returns: Ustr string
 Type: struct Ustr *

 Parameter[1]: Nothing
 Type[1]: void

 Explanation:

  This function creates an empty Ustr, owned by you, that is allocated
 from system memory, or return NULL.

 Note:

  It can be useful to ensure that the Ustr is in system memory, so that you can
 add things to it and check for errors with ustr_enomem().

Function: ustr_dup_undef()
 Returns: Ustr string
 Type: struct Ustr *

 Parameter[1]: Length of new undefined data
 Type[1]: size_t

 Explanation:

  This function creates a Ustr, owned by you, with the specified amount of data,
 allocated from system memory, that is writable. Or it'll return NULL on
 failure.

 Note:

  Like most ustr functions if the specified length of the ustr is zero, the
 returned value will just be a duplicate of a read-only C-nil-string "".
