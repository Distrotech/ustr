Section: Compile switch constants

Constant: USTR_CONF_COMPILE_USE_ATTRIBUTES

 Explanation:

  This switch controls whether gcc type __attribute__() statements are used in
 the public headers headers for the library. If the value is 1 then if they are
 supported by the compiler that built the library they will be used, if the
 value is 0 they won't be used at all.


Constant: USTR_CONF_COMPILE_TYPEDEF

 Explanation:

  This switch controls whether typedef will be used for the structs in the
 public headers for the library. If the value is 1 then they will be used,
 if the value is 0 they won't be used at all (and your code will have to use
 struct tags instead -- note all libraries using ustr should compile without
 this option set).


Section: Constants passed to ustr_cntl_opt()

Constant: USTR_CNTL_OPT_GET_REF_BYTES

 Parameter[1]: Number of bytes for default reference count in Ustr
 Type[1]: size_t *

 Explanation:

  This option will get the default number of bytes used for a reference count
 when creating Ustr's.
